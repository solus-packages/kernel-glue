# Ensure we have a valid, full environment, as we'll be calling out to
# various tools when we call clr-boot-manager update.

# Notably, we'll be calling "grub-mkconfig" on Legacy Boot systems, which
# relies on PATH and other environment pieces to correctly run os-prober,
# to detect MSWINDOWS, etc.
#
# Note this limitation is due to our current use of COMAR in eopkg, which in
# itself is D-BUS activated, thus has a stunted environemnt. Note that this
# limitation will be removed in future Solus versions by way of a modernised
# package manager.
